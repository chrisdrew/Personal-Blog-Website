            <h2>Why re-learn?</h2>
            <p>After three years (I think) away from coding anything I have decided to come back into my old field! I feel like now is a good time to get back into it. My wife and I have decided to spilt, and this is part of the reason why I want to come back. Now lets re-wind a little and see what I have done in the past.</p>
            <p>So when I first started I was a developer for an e-learning company and we used Flash (AS2), and Director! Wow I am old :/. Working with this company I have worked for some top clients like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SmartBaords</li>
                <li>RCMP</li>
                <li>Thunderbird</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After ten hard years with the company I got the bad news that I was being laid off along with six other people. I took it hard, but I walked out the door with a smile on my face saying goodbye to everyone I worked with. My wife was supper amazing and helped me get back on my feet.</p>
            <p>It took some months but I decided to go back into school this time designing/building in a different way. I decided to become a carpenter. I always loved building with my hands, so I thought why not give it a go. I passed the six month course feeling good about myself and seeing myself working for a big company. I am now working at PCL building a new hospital in Calgary for people with cancer. I am very proud of the work I am doing there, it makes me happy.</p>
            <p><strong>But</strong> now I am moved out of my house and I need a change again, so why not try at this again! I am very excited to shake this rust off!</p>
